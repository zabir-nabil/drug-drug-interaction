negative	is a This should be considered whenever these agents are prescribed concomitantly
positive	is a Concurrent administration of dyphylline and <e1>probenecid</e1> which <e2>compete</e2>s for tubular secretion has been shown to increase the plasma halflife of dyphylline
positive	is a <e1>Lithium</e1> generally should not be given with <e2>diuretics</e2> because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity

positive	is a Since the pharmacokinetics of BUSULFEX were studied in patients treated with phenytoin the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure AUC higher in patients not treated with phenytoin
positive	is a Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione use of acetaminophen prior to  72 hours or concurrent with BUSULFEX may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues
