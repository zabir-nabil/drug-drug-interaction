positive	is a For these reasons it is felt that in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone the possible benefits of combined therapy with <e1>lovastatin</e1> and a <e2>fibrate</e2> do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure
negative	is a While it is not known whether this interaction occurs with <e1>fibrates</e1> other than gemfibrozil myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occasionally been associated with the use of <e1>fibrates</e1> alone including <e2>clofibrate</e2>
positive	is a Therefore the combined use of <e2>lovastatin</e2> with <e1>fibrates</e1> should generally be avoided
negative	is a Drugdrug interactions with Mefloquine have not been explored in detail
negative	is a There is one report of cardiopulmonary arrest with full recovery in a patient who was taking a <e2>beta blocker</e2> <e1>propranolol</e1>
negative	is a The effects of Mefloquineuine on the compromised cardiovascular system have not been evaluated
negative	is a The benefits of Mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease
positive	is a Because of the danger of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval halofantrine must not be given simultaneously with or subsequent to Mefloquine
positive	is a Concomitant administration of Mefloquine and other related compounds eg quinine quinidine and chloroquine may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions
positive	is a If these drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe malaria Mefloquine administration should be delayed at least 12 hours after the last dose
positive	is a There is evidence that the use of halofantrine after Mefloquineuine causes a significant lengthening of the QTc interval
negative	is a Clinically significant QTc prolongation has not been found with Mefloquineuine alone
positive	is a This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with Mefloquine although theoretically coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction eg antiarrhythmic or betaadrenergic blocking agents calcium channel blockers antihistamines or H1blocking agents tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval
negative	is a There are no data that conclusively establish whether the concomitant administration of Mefloquineuine and the above listed agents has an effect on cardiac function
positive	is a In patients taking an anticonvulsant eg valproic acid carbamazepine phenobarbital or phenytoin the concomitant use of Mefloquine may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of the anticonvulsant
positive	is a Therefore patients concurrently taking antiseizure medication and Mefloquine should have the blood level of their antiseizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted appropriately
positive	is a When Mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded
negative	is a Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of Mefloquine
negative	is a No other drug interactions are known
positive	is a Nevertheless the effects of Mefloquine on travelers receiving comedication particularly diabetics or patients using anticoagulants should be checked before departure
negative	is a In clinical trials the concomitant administration of <e2>sulfadoxine</e2> and <e1>pyrimethamine</e1> did not alter the adverse reaction profile

positive	is a MercaptopurineAzathioprine Allopurinol inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of <e1>mercaptopurine</e1> and <e2>azathioprine</e2> to 6thiouric acid
negative	is a This oxidation which is catalyzed by <e1>xanthine</e1> oxidase inactivates <e2>mercaptopurine</e2>
positive	is a In patients receiving mercaptopurine Purinethol or azathioprine Imuran the concomitant administration of 300600 mg of allopurinol per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately onethird to onefourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine
negative	is a Subsequent adjustment of doses of <e1>mercaptopurine</e1> or <e2>azathioprine</e2> should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects
positive	is a Dicumarol It has been reported that <e2>allopurinol</e2> prolongs the halflife of the anticoagulant <e1>dicumarol</e1>
positive	is a The clinical basis of this drug interaction has not been established but should be noted when <e2>allopurinol</e2> is given to patients already on <e1>dicumarol</e1> therapy
negative	is a Consequently prothrombin time should be reassessed periodically in patients receiving both drugs
positive	is a Uricosuric Agents Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of <e2>urate</e2> <e1>uricosuric agents</e1> which increase the excretion of <e2>urate</e2> are also likely to increase the excretion of oxipurinol and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase
positive	is a The concomitant administration of <e1>uricosuric agents</e1> and <e2>allopurinol</e2> has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines hypoxanthine and xanthine and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with <e2>allopurinol</e2> alone
positive	is a Although clinical evidence to date has not demonstrated renal precipitation of oxypurines in patients either on <e2>allopurinol</e2> alone or in combination with <e1>uricosuric agents</e1> the possibility should be kept in mind
positive	is a Thiazide Diuretics The reports that the concomitant use of allopurinol and thiazide diuretics may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a causeandeffect relationship and a mechanism of causation
negative	is a Review of these case reports indicates that the patients were mainly receiving thiazide diuretics for hypertension and that tests to rule out decreased renal function secondary to hypertensive nephropathy were not often performed
negative	is a In those patients in whom renal insufficiency was documented however the recommendation to lower the dose of allopurinol was not followed
positive	is a Although a causal mechanism and a causeandeffect relationship have not been established current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on thiazide diuretics and allopurinol even in the absence of renal failure and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected
positive	is a AmpicillinAmoxicillin An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs
negative	is a The cause of the reported association has not been established
positive	is a Cytotoxic Agents Enhanced bone marrow suppression by cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease except leukemia in the presence of allopurinol
positive	is a However in a wellcontrolled study of patients with lymphoma on combination therapy allopurinol did not increase the marrow toxicity of patients treated with cyclophosphamide doxorubicin bleomycin procarbazine andor mechlorethamine
positive	is a Chlorpropamide Chlorpropamides plasma halflife may be prolonged by <e1>allopurinol</e1> since <e1>allopurinol</e1> and <e2>chlorpropamide</e2> may compete for excretion in the renal tubule
positive	is a The risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increased if <e1>allopurinol</e1> and <e2>chlorpropamide</e2> are given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency
positive	is a Cyclosporin Reports indicate that cyclosporine levels may be increased during concomitant treatment with allopurinol sodium for injection
negative	is a Monitoring of cyclosporine levels and possible adjustment of cyclosporine dosage should be considered when these drugs are coadministered
positive	is a <e2>Tolbutamide</e2>s conversion to inactive <e1>metabolites</e1> has been shown to be catalyzed by xanthine oxidase from rat liver
negative	is a The clinical significance if any of these observations is unknown
negative	is a Administration of repeat doses of <e1>FACTIVE</e1> had no effect on the repeat dose pharmacokinetics of theophylline digoxin or an <e2>ethinylestradiol</e2>levonorgestrol oral contraceptive product in healthy subjects
negative	is a Concomitant administration of <e1>FACTIVE</e1> and <e2>calcium carbonate</e2> cimetidine omeprazole or an estrogenprogesterone oral contraceptive produced minor changes in the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin which were considered to be without clinical significance
positive	is a Concomitant administration of <e1>FACTIVE</e1> with probenecid resulted in a 45 increase in systemic exposure to <e2>gemifloxacin</e2>
positive	is a FACTIVE had no significant effect on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin in healthy subjects on stable warfarin therapy
positive	is a However because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of <e2>warfarin</e2> or its <e1>derivatives</e1> in patients the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered concomitantly with <e2>warfarin</e2> or its <e1>derivatives</e1>
negative	is a Quinolones form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metals
positive	is a The absorption of oral gemifloxacin is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of an <e2>antacid</e2> containing aluminum and <e1>magnesium</e1>

positive	is a Thus agents <e2>likely</e2> to be concomitantly administered with <e1>Chirocaine</e1> that are metabolized by this isoenzyme family may potentially interact with <e1>Chirocaine</e1>
positive	is a Although no clinical studies have been conducted it is likely that the metabolism of levobupivacaine may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers such as phenytoin phenobarbital rifampin CYP3A4 inhibitors azole antimycotics e

positive	is a Dosage adjustment may be warranted when <e1>levobupivacaine</e1> is concurrently administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors and <e2>CYP1A2</e2> inhibitors as systemic <e1>levobupivacaine</e1> levels may rise resulting in toxicity
positive	is a The coadministration of aspirin decreases the biologic halflife of fenoprofen because of an increase in metabolic clearance that results in a greater amount of hydroxylated fenoprofen in the urine
positive	is a Although the mechanism of interaction between <e1>fenoprofen</e1> and aspirin is not totally known enzyme induction and displacement of <e1>fenoprofen</e1> from <e2>plasma albumin</e2> binding sites are possibilities
positive	is a Because <e2>Nalfon</e2> has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with <e1>aspirin</e1> alone and because <e1>aspirin</e1> increases the rate of excretion of <e2>Nalfon</e2> the concomitant use of <e2>Nalfon</e2> and salicylates is not recommended
positive	is a Chronic administration of phenobarbital a known enzyme inducer may be associated with a decrease in the plasma halflife of fenoprofen
positive	is a When phenobarbital is added to or withdrawn from treatment dosage adjustment of Nalfon may be required
positive	is a In vitro studies have shown that fenoprofen because of its affinity for albumin may displace from their binding sites other drugs that are also albumin bound and this may lead to drug interaction
negative	is a Theoretically fenoprofen could likewise be displaced
negative	is a Patients receiving hydantoins sulfonamides or sulfonylureas should be observed for increased activity of these drugs and therefore signs of toxicity from these drugs
negative	is a In patients receiving coumarintype anticoagulants the addition of Nalfon to therapy could prolong the prothrombin time
negative	is a Patients receiving both drugs should be under careful observation

negative	is a After stopping Fluvoxamine Tablets at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a MAOI
positive	is a Potential Terfenadine Astemizole and Cisapride InteractionsTerfenadine <e1>astemizole</e1> and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 <e2>isozyme</e2> and it has been demonstrated that ketoconazole a potent inhibitor of IIIA4 blocks the metabolism of these drugs resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug
negative	is a Increased plasma concentrations of terfenadine <e1>astemizole</e1> and <e2>cisapride</e2> cause QT prolongation and have been associated with torsades de pointestype ventricular tachycardia sometimes fatal

negative	is a were coadministered to steady state plasma concentration and other pharmacokinetics parameters AUC Cmax T12 of alprazolam were approximately twice those observed when alprazolam was administered aloneoral clearance was reduced by about 50
negative	is a The elevated plasma alprazolam concentrations resulted in decreased psychomotor performance and memory
negative	is a This interaction which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is coadministered particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100300 mg
negative	is a If alprazolam is coadministered with Fluvoxamine Tablets the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended
negative	is a No dosage adjustment is required for Fluvoxamine Tablets
positive	is a Diazepam The coadministration of Fluvoxamine Tablets and diazepam is generally not advisable
positive	is a Because fluvoxamine reduces the clearance of both diazepam and its active metabolite Ndesmethyldiazepam there is a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic coadministration
positive	is a Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to coadminister fluvoxamine and diazepam is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mgday of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam
negative	is a In these subjects R B the clearance of diazepam was reduced by 65 and that of Ndesmethyldiazepam to a level that was too low to measure over the course of the 2 week long study
